# The DVT Home Staking Curriculum

## What is this?

This is a knowledge base for Ethereum solo stakers (both native and DVT) designed with non-technical users in mind. It serves as a comprehensive curriculum for aspiring solo stakers.

With a standardised curriculum, organisations can fairly assess the proficiency of new solo stakers across the board using simple quizzes and on/off-chain deliverables when facilitating grants and incentivised test programmes.

This curriculum incorporates DVT, and native home staking methods so new solo stakers can launch their first home-based ETH validator from as little as 1 ETH.

## Who is this for?

While I hope that anyone who cares about keeping the Ethereum network decentralised will find this guide helpful, the way it is written caters to the following audiences of non-technical people:

1. Aspiring solo/home staker trying to go from zero to one
2. Existing solo/home staker looking to refresh your knowledge.

## How to use?

This curriculum has 2 major segments:

1. **Segment 1:** Practicing on the Testnet (current segment)
2. **Segment 2:** [Replacement steps to transition onto the Mainnet ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZRc5aeQgk267aLADwYv5/s/FoGzpVzGOOby9LLDFqRC/)
