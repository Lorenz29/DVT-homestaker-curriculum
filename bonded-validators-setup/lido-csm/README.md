# Lido CSM

The [Community Staking Module (CSM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module) is the [Lido protocol’s](https://lido.fi/) first module with permissionless entry, allowing any node operator to operate validators by providing an ETH-based bond as security collateral

## Workflow breakdown

Recall that running bonded validators via the Lido CSM does not require setting up a separate service on your hardware.

{% content-ref url="../../understanding-eth-validators/bonded-validators.md" %}
[bonded-validators.md](../../understanding-eth-validators/bonded-validators.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Instead, you simply tweak the parameters of the following steps of the native solo staking setup.

## How CSM works

As an overview, the Lido CSM deposits valid validator keys uploaded by node operators if the minimum bond required has also been provided.

{% hint style="info" %}
**"Valid validator keys"** in this case refers to validator keystores generated while setting the `withdrawalAddress` field to the Lido CSM contract.
{% endhint %}

### Rewards&#x20;

Solo stakers receive rewards from 2 sources:

1. **Bond rebase**: staking rewards generated from the bonded tokens ((w)stETH)--e.g., `90% * ETH PoS staking yield * total ETH bond provided`
2. **Node Operator rewards**: a 7% share of rewards from the active validator keys deposited by the Lido Protocol with possible reductions for bad performance--e.g., `7% * ETH PoS staking yield * total validator keys deposited (32 ETH each) - poor performance penalties`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The share of rewards % above apply only on CSM Holesky testnet. The values for mainnet may differ and will be set upon the mainnet launch by DAO vote
{% endhint %}

Further, CSM operators will enjoy 2 additional rewards features described in more detail [here](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-6f17b30ed89d4b7eacc5d94a6a9a6095):

* **Rewards smoothing** across all Lido modules (e.g., block proposer rewards, sync committee rewards)
* **Rewards socialisation** among validators whose performance exceeds a certain threshold and underperforming validators will receive no node operator rewards for the given frame

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Illustration on Rewards Socialisation</p></figcaption></figure>

### Bond mechanics

#### Providing the CSM bond

The required bond amounts can be provided by anyone, although it will most likely come from the node operator using the CSM (CSM operator) themselves.

#### Bond decrease

The bond provided serves as a deterrence against dishonest behaviours and poor performance by the node operator. e.g.,

1. **MEV theft:**  If detected, a fine will be imposed by burning part of the node operator's bond and an amount of bond equivalent to the stolen amount will be locked until it is made whole.
2. **Slashing events:** Slashing penalties will be deducted from the bond amount and burnt
3. **Sustained poor performance:** If the effective balance of any validators fall below 32 ETH, the shortfall will be deducted from the bond amount and burnt

These events will cause the net bond balance of the CSM operator to fall below the required threshold.&#x20;

In this scenario, the CSM node operator will cease to accrue rewards on their validator keys deposited by Lido CSM until:

* The CSM node operator tops up the shortage
* New rewards generated by the CSM node operator fills up the shortage--e.g., All new rewards will be used to replenish the bond shortage until it is back to the required level

#### Bond increase

On the other hand, because the bond is provided in stETH (which rebases in quantity), the bond balance of CSM operators will increase over time, above the required threshold.

Excess bond balance, together with accrued rewards, will be claimable by CSM operators from the CSM Web App.

{% hint style="info" %}
More details on bond mechanics [here](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-268ecefc0b37498badc1bf0baab04e0b).
{% endhint %}

### Rewards Address & Manager Address

There are 2 main addresses used by CSM operators.

1. **Rewards Address:** This is the address that all accrued rewards and excess bond amounts will go to when claimed. Rewards Addresses can change Manager Addresses but Rewards Addresses can only be changed by itself.
2. **Manager Address:** This is the address that can trigger the claiming of all accrued rewards and excess bond amounts to the Rewards Address. The Manager Address can also upload/remove new/existing deposit data files. The Manager Address cannot change the Rewards Address.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 10.51.27 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Break down of scope for each address. Source: <a href="https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-c58d307283e942ecab5eeb96f9a89235">Lido CSM operator portal</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Upon creation of a Node Operator these addresses are set equal, but they can be changed afterwards.

It is recommended to use different addresses for security reasons. A hot wallet may be used for the Manager address to simplify daily operations, while a cold wallet is preferable for the Rewards address to enhance security. Node Operators are solely responsible for the security of the private keys related to these addresses.

{% hint style="success" %}
For example, CSM operators with their hot wallet addresses included in the Early Adoption list can change their Rewards Address to a more secure address
{% endhint %}

**More details on Rewards vs Manager addresses** [**here**](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-268ecefc0b37498badc1bf0baab04e0b)**.**

## Key settings to note

These settings are part of the expectations for all node operators participating in the CSM. Read more [here](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-c58d307283e942ecab5eeb96f9a89235).

### Keystore generation--Withdrawal address

* During the validator key generation step, generate a number of validator keystores along with the deposit data file while setting the `withdrawalAddress` field to the Lido CSM contract on **Holesky:** [`0xF0179dEC45a37423EAD4FaD5fCb136197872EAd9`](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xF0179dEC45a37423EAD4FaD5fCb136197872EAd9)

{% hint style="info" %}
**DO NOT DEPOSIT 32 ETH** using the deposit data file generated this way as the Lido CSM will make the deposit for you. _**Doing so will result in a loss of funds.**_
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="../../keystore-generation-and-mev-boost/validator-key-generation.md" %}
[validator-key-generation.md](../../keystore-generation-and-mev-boost/validator-key-generation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You will then upload your `deposit data file` in the [next section](upload-remove-view-validator-keys.md). Make sure you complete the remaining steps on this page before that.&#x20;

### **Validator Client Setup--Fee Recipient Address**

* During the validator client setup step, set the `fee_recipient` flag to the designated fee recipient address for Lido CSM on **Holesky:** [`0xE73a3602b99f1f913e72F8bdcBC235e206794Ac8`](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xE73a3602b99f1f913e72F8bdcBC235e206794Ac8)

{% content-ref url="../../native-solo-staking-setup/validator-client-setup/" %}
[validator-client-setup](../../native-solo-staking-setup/validator-client-setup/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For existing solo stakers, you can spin up a new validator client service specifically for your CSM validator keys so that you can retain your own `fee_recipient` address for your solo staking keys. Refer to [this sub-section](running-a-separate-vc-service.md).
{% endhint %}

### **MEV-Boost Setup--Relay endpoints**

* Do not set the `-min-bid` flag or set it to 0
* During the MEV-Boost setup step, set the `-relay` flags only to the list of designated MEV relays for Lido CSM on **Holesky** below.&#x20;
